## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Alvin

I'm currently studying Informatics Systems at the Open University and have created projects like [Urbia](urbia.vercel.app), which is a company website for an architectural studio.
Still learning web development and keeping up with the tech world.
You can check my website on [Alvin Portfolio](alvinxal.my.id)
